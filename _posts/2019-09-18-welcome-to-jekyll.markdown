You’ll find this post in your `_posts` directory. Go ahead and edit it and re-build the site to see your changes. You can rebuild the site in many different ways, but the most common way is to run `jekyll serve`, which launches a web server and auto-regenerates your site when a file is updated.

To add new posts, simply add a file in the `_posts` directory that follows the convention `YYYY-MM-DD-name-of-post.ext` and includes the necessary front matter. Take a look at the source for this post to get an idea about how it works.

Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:

```ruby
def print_hi(name)
  puts "Hi, #{name}"
end
print_hi('Tom')
#=> prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.
```


## testh2

The golden rule of CoffeeScript is: “It’s just JavaScript.” The code compiles one-to-one into the equivalent JS, and there is no interpretation at runtime. You can use any existing JavaScript library seamlessly from CoffeeScript (and vice-versa). The compiled output is readable, pretty-printed, and tends to run as fast or faster than the equivalent handwritten JavaScript.

### testh3

```python
def test2():
  print("hello world")
```

**Hey** I want this paragraph wrapped in a class called my-custom-class
{: class="my-custom-class"}

### What’s New In CoffeeScript 2?

The biggest change in CoffeeScript 2 is that now the `CoffeeScript` compiler produces modern JavaScript syntax (ES6, or ES2015 and later). A CoffeeScript => becomes a JS `=>`, a CoffeeScript `class` becomes a JS class and so on. Major new features in CoffeeScript 2 include async functions and JSX. You can read more in the announcement.
